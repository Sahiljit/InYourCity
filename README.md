# InYourCity

This is full Stack  application made using **Next.js**. The main objective was to work with Next.js and understand what the hype was all about. Leaving the features of Next.js (like **SEO, SSR, SSG**) aside, the fact that we can create backend APIs (using node) inside next only, really impressed me.

The **Idea** was to build a web app where admin can list various events and user can search events on the basis of their city, month and category. Like this,  users will know about events happening in their cities in a particular month and won't miss out.
